== Contribute ==

StickyAdmin started as a simple project about two years ago and recently I came to the conclusion that it'd be impossible for only one individual to get it done the right way, so hereby I request everyone's help to get involved in developing a better yet compatbile interface for the admin side of WordPress.

Developers of all levels can help!

Like WordPress itself, StickyAdmin is and will remain open-source. You can test planned improvements, check out the code, file and view bug reports, and even submit your own patches. The community’s contributions are what make WordPress and StickyAdmin so strong.

Most software projects, including WordPress, use a version-control system to keep track of source code and revisions. 

StickyAdmin is available on GitHub, all development process happens over here:
https://github.com/doriandrn/stickyadmin

Start with creating your branch and submitting your patches!


== Installation ==

The easiest way to install StickyAdmin is via your site’s Dashboard. 
Please follow these instructions:

1. Log in to your site’s Dashboard (e.g. www.yourgroovydomain.com/wp-admin)
2. Click on the “Plugins” tab in the left panel, then click “Add New”.
3. Search for “StickyAdmin” and the latest version will appear at the top of the list of results.
4. Install it by clicking the “Install Now” link.
5. When installation finishes, click “Activate Plugin”.

You’re done!

= Manual Install: =

1. Upload stickyadmin to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

If you're having troubles with the installation process please don't hesitate to open up a new support topic by navigating to the Support tab here. 

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is StickyAdmin ready for production? =
Not yet.

= What is failsafe mode? =
Some installs may interfere with Sticky (something we don't want) and this way the plugin triggers it's failsafe mode which still gets the interface replaced no matter if there are JS or server errors in the stack. Logs can help us develpers figure what is conflicting.


== Screenshots ==
