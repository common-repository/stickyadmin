# Contributor's Guidelines

Community made patches, localizations, bug reports and contributions are always welcome and crucial to ensure StickyAdmin remains the most powerfull admin interface for WordPress. 

When contributing please ensure you follow the guidelines below to help us keep on top of things.

## Contributing To The Core

### Reporting Issues

Reporting issues is a great way to became a contributor as it doesn't require technical skills. In fact you don't even need to know a programming language or to be able to check the code itself, you just need to make sure that everything works as expected and [submit an issue report](https://github.com/doriandrn/stickyadmin/issues/new) if you spot a bug. Sound like something you're up for? Go for it!

#### How To Submit An Issue Report

If something isn't working, congratulations you've found a bug! Help us fix it by submitting an issue report:

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
* Search the [Existing Issues](https://github.com/dorian/stickyadmin/issues) to be sure that the one you've noticed isn't already there
* Submit a report for your issue
* Clearly describe the issue (including steps to reproduce it if it's a bug)
* Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue.

### Making Changes

Making changes to the core is a key way to help us improve StickyAdmin. You will need some technical skills to make a change, like knowing a bit of PHP, CSS, SASS or JavaScript.

If you think something could be improved and you're able to do so, make your changes and submit a Pull Request. We will be pleased to get it.

#### How To Submit A Pull Request

* Fork the repository on GitHub
* Make the changes to your forked repository
  * **Ensure you stick to the [WordPress Coding Standards](http://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/coding-standards/php/).**
  * Ensure you use LF line endings - no Windows line endings, please
* When committing, reference your issue number (#1234) and include a note about the fix
* Push the changes to your fork and submit a pull request on the master branch of the StickyAdmin repository. 
* Please **don't** modify the changelog - this will be maintained by the StickyAdmin developers.
* Please **don't** add your localizations or update the .pot files - these will also be maintained by the StickyAdmin developers. To contribute to the localization of StickyAdmin, please join the [translate.wordpress.org project](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/stickyadmin). This is much needed, if you speak a language that needs translating consider yourself officially invited to the party.

After you follow the step above, the next stage will be waiting on us to merge your Pull Request. We review them all, and make suggestions and changes as and if necessary.

## Contribute To Localizing StickyAdmin

Localization is a very important part of StickyAdmin. We believe in net neutrality and want our platform to be available to everyone, everywhere with equal ease. When you localize StickyAdmin, you are helping hundreds of people in the world, and all the people who speak your language. That's pretty neat.

### Glossary & Style Guide

Please refer to this page on the [Translator Handbook](https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/translating/glossary-style-guide/) for information about the glossary and the style guide.

### Translating The Core

We have a [project on translate.wordpress.org](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/stickyadmin). You can join the localization team of your language and help by translating StickyAdmin.
